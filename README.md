# REBEL RUSH 

## What is it?

"Rebel Rush" is a side scrolling shooting game indie game inspired by Flappy BIrd movement and Jetpack Joyride aesthetic. 

## How to Play?

At the moment the game is only playable on Windows Systems.
Users are also required to have SFML library installed on their devices (if you have problems check [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oh-tmxtIrA)).

In the case you verify some type of errors about Texture loading, try edit your run/debug configuration choosing the project path as Working Directory.
